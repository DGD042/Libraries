Important notes:

    This repository has all the libraries that I use for all
    my codes in Python, it has from extracting information from
    .csv, .xls, .txt and .nc files to use different information analysis
    guided for climate and weather information.

    Sadly all the information is written in Spanish, I'll begin to
    translate all the different information in english, I hope whoever 
    finds this repository make good use for it.
