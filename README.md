Important notes:

	This repository have all the libraries that I use for all
	my codes in Python, it has from extracting information from
	.csv, .xls and .txt files to do different information analysis
	guided for climate and weather information.

	Sadly all the information is written in Spanish, I'll begin to
	translate all the different information in english, I hope whoever 
	finds this repository make good use for it.
